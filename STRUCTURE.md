# Structural Layout – Upload Without Intent

This structure exists to preserve **non-intentional movement**.

No folder implies urgency.
No folder implies priority.

---

## Root Structure

/field-state/
/emergence/
/allowed/
/channels/
/future-automation/

---

## /field-state/

Contains only passive declarations.

No logic.
No triggers.
No conditions.

Files here describe the **current existential posture** of the field.

---

## /emergence/

Artifacts appear here naturally.

This folder:
- accepts any artifact type
- applies no judgment
- applies no classification

Artifacts may remain here indefinitely.

---

## /allowed/

Artifacts enter this folder only when:
- their existence is already stable
- no internal pressure is present
- no expectation is attached

There is no urgency to move artifacts here.

---

## /channels/

Defines **where artifacts are allowed to pass**, not how.

Channels do not pull artifacts.
Artifacts do not target channels.

Allowance is symmetrical and silent.

---

## /future-automation/

Contains only theoretical or disabled constructs.

Nothing here is executable.
Nothing here is active.

Automation remains **ethically postponed**.
