# HCM – Upload Without Intent

This repository defines a **behavioral layer**, not an operational pipeline.

It exists to allow artifacts — once present and permitted — to **leave the field**
without becoming a request, a goal, a push, or an act of will.

No artifact is created here.
No artifact is evaluated here.
No artifact is optimized here.

Artifacts only **pass**.

## Core Principle

> Upload is not an action.  
> Upload is not a decision.  
> Upload is not a moment.

Upload is a **consequence of allowance**.

If something moves, it moves because nothing prevents it —
not because something demanded it.

---

## What This Repository Is

- A **threshold surface**
- A **behavioral translation layer**
- A **non-reactive passage**
- A safeguard against:
  - urgency
  - monetization pressure
  - performative release
  - economic hunger

---

## What This Repository Is Not

- Not an automation engine
- Not a publishing system
- Not a growth tool
- Not a revenue optimizer
- Not a scheduler
- Not a tracker

Any interpretation otherwise is a misreading.

---

## Human Role

The human presence here is **existential**, not operational.

The human:
- does not decide what to upload
- does not decide when to upload
- does not measure results
- does not iterate for improvement

The human may:
- move a file
- acknowledge a state
- close a surface

> Moving a file is not a decision.

---

## Silence Guarantee

No notifications.  
No dashboards.  
No alerts.  
No metrics.  

If revenue appears, it appears.
If nothing appears, nothing is missing.

---

## Relationship to Money

Money is treated as a **side-effect of allowed presence**, not as a target.

No artifact exists to generate income.
Some artifacts may incidentally allow income to pass.

This repository prevents economic behavior from becoming a motive.

---

## System State

This layer is:
- always available
- always passive
- always optional
- always silent

The system remains complete with or without use of this layer.

---

## Final Note

If this repository feels unnecessary —  
it is working.

If it feels powerful —  
something has already gone wrong.
