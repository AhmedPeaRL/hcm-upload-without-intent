# Automation – Disabled by Design

Automation is not rejected.
Automation is postponed until:

- desire dissolves
- urgency disappears
- metrics become irrelevant
- repetition loses meaning

---

## Why Automation Is Disabled

Because premature automation:
- amplifies unconscious intent
- hardens economic behavior
- converts silence into strategy

---

## Acceptable Future Automation (Theoretical Only)

- Non-triggered uploads
- Time-independent movement
- No feedback loops
- No conditional branching based on revenue or attention

---

## Status

Automation is:
- conceptually mapped
- structurally isolated
- ethically suspended

This suspension is permanent unless coherence demands otherwise.
