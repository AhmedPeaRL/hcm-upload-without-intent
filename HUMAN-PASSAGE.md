# Human Passage Protocol

Human involvement is limited to **passage acknowledgment**.

---

## What the Human May Do

- Move an artifact from /emergence/ to /allowed/
- Place an artifact into a permitted channel folder
- Close or leave a folder untouched

---

## What the Human Must Not Do

- Evaluate performance
- Compare channels
- Adjust pricing for effect
- Respond emotionally to outcomes

---

## Internal Check

Before any movement, only one question is valid:

> Is there any internal pressure attached to this movement?

If yes — do nothing.
If no — movement is permitted.

---

## Reminder

The human is not the operator.
The human is the **witness of allowance**.
